## Projects / Milestones ###

- [KomodoOcean](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoOcean) (Komodo-Qt) [2018-2019] - completed development of the first native Qt wallet for Komodo and Zcash based fork. Last year we completed various wallet improvements, added sapling support into it, fixed minor issues and finally make komodo-qt available for all 3 OS (Windows, Linux and MacOS). Komodo-qt now is available on [https://komodoplatform.com/](https://komodoplatform.com/) in [Wallets](https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/) section.

- [SuperNET](https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET) / Iguana (Improvement of Iguana) [2018-2019] - added support of 2-bytes network prefix coins (like HUSH) in iguana, investigating and fixing various issues, marked as important by notary node operators, adding *sapling* support in dPOW and splitfunds and other related things. Here is a [full list](https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/commits?author=DeckerSU) of Decker's contributions to iguana, merged into SuperNET repo branch, used by other notaries.

- [BarterDEX](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX) / marketmaker (v1.0) [Feb 2019] - fixed a few sapling related issues (tx signing, withdraw method crash with many vouts) in BarterDEX marketmaker 1.0 to make current release work with sapling enabled chains.

- Notary Node Elections Management [2018] - provided technical assistant throughout all stages of the notary node Elections of 2018 (KMD blockchain snapshot creation, airdropping VOTE2018, statistical analysis, results checking, etc.) 

- [Z-NOMP fork](https://github.com/DeckerSU/z-nomp) [Dec 2018] - created a fork of Z-NOMP with support for KMD and sapling enabled assetchains. Recnetly we made few important bugs fixes like preventing the possibility of creating "fake shares" in some cases.

- [komodo-explorers-install](https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install) [2018-2019] created and maintained a "one-click" explorer install repo for KMD and assetchains to help everyone deploy it quickly and without any issues. The latest iteration of Insight based Komodo explorers running using this repo.

- [CoinBin](https://github.com/DeckerSU/coinbin/tree/komodo) fork for Komodo [2018-2019] - created a fork of awesome OutCast3k's blockchain tools with KMD support. It's already integrated with official Komodo Explorer and allows you to create and sign transactions, addresses in KMD network using Javascript enabled browser only. The most important point was implementing sapling txes support, whichis now done and CoinBin can be used by everybody, for manual creating txes or in blockchain related things learning. Live version of Komodo's CoinBin is available [here](https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#home).

- [komodo_scripts](https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts) [2018] - created a repo with various helper scripts for new notary node operators. This helped newcomers setup their notary nodes faster and decreased the learning curve to maintain the server. 

- [kmd-qt-wallet](https://github.com/DeckerSU/zec-qt-wallet/tree/komodo) [Jan 2019] -   created a fork of zec-qt-wallet adopted for using with KMD daemon (komodod). It's not a full-node itself, it's just a Qt GUI that interacts with komodo daemon (komodod) via RPC calls.

- [bip44-quick-gen](https://github.com/DeckerSU/bip44-quick-gen) [Nov 2018] - developed the helper tool to import addresses derived from BIP44 mnemonic to komodod or komodo-qt (can be used with Ledger seed, to import your addresses from Ledger Nano into komodo. 

- [WooCommerce-KMD](https://wordpress.org/plugins/komodo-for-woocommerce/) [Nov 2018] - participated in solving some issues during developent of WooCommerce-KMD plugin.
